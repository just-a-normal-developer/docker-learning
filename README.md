# docker-learning
This is just a learning project about docker This project has built in Django and i use some simple codes in dockerfile and docker compose that is for running Django with python 3.8 Generally I hope this help you for writing the docker part of your project
actually i realized that you can use newer version of docker instead of this old method if you are interested in new method search and go for docker swarm it needs some files like docker-stack.yaml
